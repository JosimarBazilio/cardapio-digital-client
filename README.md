### Project Idea 

The idea come from a bar where the menu was always outdated and it cause a little discomfort in the owners, there's
always new customers confused with was or not in the menu.
<br>
So, our idea is, create a menu where the customers can scan a QR Code to acess the products and see in real time what's
in the menu for the day, they can also see the order status, if its already being prepared or its ready to eat!
<br>
Now talking about the owner and its employees, they can also use our product!
<br>
The owner can register new employees and attribute their job with it, he can also create new jobs if its necessary.
Talking about the bartender again, he can show the QR Code for the customers and check the order status, its easier,
right? Our clients doesn't have to worry about the app, we make and keep it simple.
